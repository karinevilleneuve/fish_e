# Required files, scripts and programs {-}

## Programs {-}

- [Sekquit](https://bioinf.shenwei.me/seqkit/)
	- Installed via conda
	- Base environment needs to be activated in order to use the tool
	
- RDP tool classifier - [Github](https://github.com/rdpstaff/classifier) / [SourceForge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/rdp-classifier/#:~:text=The%20RDP%20Classifier%20is%20a,confidence%20estimates%20for%20each%20assignment.)
  - To install the RDP classifier I recommend downloading the package from SourceForge ([link](https://sourceforge.net/projects/rdp-classifier/)) as the Github is no longer maintained. Once the download is complete, unzip the folder and locate the file `classifer.jar` inside the directory `dist`
  
- [Usearch v11.0.667](http://www.drive5.com/usearch/)
  - To install : (1) Download binaries (2) Unzip and rename the file to `usearch` (3) Make file executable `chmod +x usearch`. Place file in an easily accessible directory (for example `~/usearch`)
